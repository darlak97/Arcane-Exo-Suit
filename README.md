# Arcane-Exo-Suit
An attractive armor piece with a built in progression system | Hytale mod

A mod built around the challenge of obtaining a mysterious armor piece that takes real progression to get, but grants powerful runic abilities.

The Exo-Suit is assembled from scrap dropped by "Skeleton Burnt Praetorians", and it can’t be fixed at standard stations. You need a special "Armor Station" from the Arcane workbench, where you can repair and upgrade the suit with either "wind" or "lightning" runic powers, each very distinct and strong.
